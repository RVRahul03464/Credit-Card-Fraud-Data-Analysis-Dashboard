Credit Card Fraud Data Analysis Dashboard – End-to-End Project

Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze credit card transactions, detect fraudulent activities, and identify fraud trends using Power BI. This dashboard enables financial institutions to improve fraud detection and security measures.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of three key components:
•	Transaction Details: Transaction ID, Merchant, Category, Amount, Date, City, State.
•	Fraud Indicators: Fraudulent (Yes/No), Fraud Amount, Fraud Rate.
•	Demographic Data: Age, City Population.

Data Preparation:
•	Data Cleaning: Handling duplicates, missing values, and formatting date fields.
•	Data Transformation: Calculating fraud rates, average transaction amounts, and fraud percentages.
•	Data Modeling: Establishing relationships between transaction data, location data, and fraud indicators.

Key Metrics & Insights:

•	Fraud Analysis: 
o	Count and percentage of fraudulent transactions.
o	Fraud rate by state, category, and merchant.
o	Total and average fraud amount.

•	Transaction Insights: 
o	Total number of transactions.
o	Total transaction amount and average transaction value.
o	Maximum and minimum transaction amounts.
o	Transactions by city and merchant.

•	Demographic Insights: 
o	Average age of customers.
o	Sum of city populations in the dataset.

Interactive Filters (Slicers):
•	Year, month, and day filters for trend analysis.
•	City and state filters for geographic fraud patterns.

Dashboard Visualizations:
•	Bar Charts: Transactions by merchant, category, and state.
•	Line Graphs: Monthly and yearly fraud trends.
•	Pie Charts: Fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
•	Maps: Geographic fraud hotspots and transaction distribution.
•	KPI Cards: Key fraud and transaction statistics.

Expected Outcomes:
This Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights into fraud trends, high-risk merchants, and geographic fraud hotspots. It enables financial institutions to enhance fraud detection, optimize security protocols, and minimize financial losses.
